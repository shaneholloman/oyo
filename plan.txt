Possible next features (post‑diff‑viewer completeness)
1. Conflict view (read‑only): highlight <<<<<<< / ======= / >>>>>>> and jump between them.
2. Fold unchanged blocks: toggle to collapse long context sections.
3. Quick file search: type‑ahead + jump (distinct from filter).
4. Copy patch/hunk: clipboard export in unified diff format.
5. Performance guardrails: lazy line rendering for huge files.
